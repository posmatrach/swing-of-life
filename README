Implementation of popular cellular automata - John Conway's Game of Life.
Features:
* Swing UI, but supports different UI implementations.
* Uses Tapestry IoC for dependency injection.
* Rules decoupled from structure by design. (Provides possibility of defining custom rules, swapping them in runtime and so on, in the future.)
