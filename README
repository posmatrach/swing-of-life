Implementation of popular cellular automation, zero-player game - John Conway's Game of Life.

Features:
* Uses Swing for UI.
* Uses Tapestry IoC for dependency injection.
* Uses Foxtrot for multi-threading.
* Rules decoupled from structure by design. (Provides possibility of defining custom rules, swapping them in runtime and so on, in the future.)

TODO
* Fix issues with IoC
* Improve life algorithm (possible parallel implementation?)
* Make life implementations swappable in runtime.
* Add support for designing and saving patterns
* Add support for rule definition and swapping in runtime
* Add UI observer style UI binding.
